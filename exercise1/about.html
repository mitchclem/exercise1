    <h3> So, what's Dr. Mario all about?
    </h3>

    <p>
        Dr. Mario originated from 1990's Mario acade-style action puzzle video
        of the same name. Then, in 2001, standing 3-foot 5-inches at the ripe
        age of 11, Dr. Mario appeared in the popular Nintendo fighting game
        Super Smash Bros Melee. </p>
    <p>
        With an arsenal consisting of Megavitamins,
        the electric hand, the fisticus, and deflection cape, Dr. Mario was quick
        to assert his dominence. Although plagued with terrible recovery, his quick
        roll, fast air travel, and abundance of punishing power in a small package
        struck the hearts of Smash Bros players around the world.
    </p>
    <p> From 2008 to 2014, Dr. Mario received a well deserved break from his
        fighting career as he was not included in the next game of the Super
        Smash Bros series, titled "Brawl". Dr. Mario was in his late teens and
        early 20's, so needless to say, his "party hiatus" had no shortage of
        yachts, women, and gold doubloons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually in 2014, Dr. Mario made his much anticipated return in the next Super Smash Bros
        installment for 3DS and Wii U. However, in his late 20's after years
        of reckless behavior, Dr. Mario faces an increase of diverse competition
        and is no longer as dominant as he once was.
